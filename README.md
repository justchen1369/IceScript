Ice Bear wants to make a joke programming language. Confusing. Please don't use in serious cases unless you are Devin or Dyn, Or if you're just a masochist [Devin], then holy fuck.

It won awards.. bad ones
- "Devin it doesn't work"
- "Help, this code is making me hang by a fucking thread."
- "console.log("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA")
